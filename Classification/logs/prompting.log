[INFO] Line 5: False	 | To determine the subject type based on the provided EMG time series, we can analyze the characteristics of the signal.

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The EMG signal shows a range of amplitudes, with peaks reaching up to 6 µV. This indicates significant muscle activity, which can be seen in both healthy individuals and those with neuromuscular disorders.

2. **Pattern of Activity**: The EMG signal exhibits both high-frequency bursts and lower-frequency activity. The presence of high-frequency bursts can indicate muscle fiber recruitment patterns that are often seen in healthy individuals. However, the presence of low-frequency activity and the overall variability in the signal can suggest underlying issues.

3. **Overall Trends**: The signal shows fluctuations that could indicate muscle fatigue or abnormal muscle activation patterns. The presence of negative values and the variability in amplitude suggest that there may be some neuromuscular dysfunction.

4. **Comparison with Subject Types**:
   - **Healthy (normal)**: Typically shows consistent and predictable patterns with less variability.
   - **Myopathy**: Often presents with lower amplitude and more consistent patterns due to muscle weakness.
   - **Neuropathy**: Can show irregular patterns with significant variability and abnormal firing rates.

Given the characteristics of the EMG signal, particularly the variability and the presence of both high and low amplitude bursts, it is more indicative of a neuropathic condition rather than a healthy or myopathic state.

Thus, the conclusion is that the subject type is likely:

The answer is [C] || 2025-11-13 17:44:48

[INFO] Line 8: False	 | The answer is [B] || 2025-11-13 17:44:48
[INFO] Line 9: True	 | To determine the subject type based on the provided EMG time series, we can analyze the characteristics of the signal.

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The EMG signal shows significant fluctuations, with peaks reaching up to 6 µV. This indicates a high level of muscle activity, which can be seen in both healthy individuals and those with neuromuscular disorders.

2. **Patterns of Activity**: The presence of both positive and negative peaks suggests a complex pattern of muscle activation. The variability in amplitude and the presence of high peaks may indicate muscle fatigue or abnormal muscle recruitment patterns, which are often associated with myopathy or neuropathy.

3. **Frequency and Duration**: The EMG signal appears to have a mix of low and high-frequency components, which can be indicative of different muscle fiber types being activated. The presence of high-frequency bursts may suggest neuropathic changes.

4. **Overall Trends**: The overall trend of the signal shows a mix of normal and abnormal activity, with some sections indicating potential muscle fatigue or abnormal firing patterns.

Given these observations, the EMG signal does not exhibit the typical characteristics of a healthy (normal) muscle response. The presence of significant fluctuations and potential signs of muscle fatigue or abnormal recruitment patterns suggests that the subject may have a neuromuscular condition.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate classification for this EMG time series is:

[INFO] Line 17: False	 | To determine the subject type based on the provided EMG time series, we can analyze the characteristics of the signal.

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The EMG signal shows a range of amplitudes, with peaks reaching around 4-5 µV. This indicates significant muscle activity, which can be seen in healthy individuals or those with certain conditions.

2. **Variability**: The signal exhibits fluctuations, with both positive and negative peaks. This variability can suggest different muscle recruitment patterns.

3. **Patterns**: The presence of high peaks and low troughs may indicate muscle fatigue or abnormal muscle activation patterns, which are often seen in myopathy or neuropathy.

4. **Overall Trends**: The overall trend of the signal appears to have a mix of normal and abnormal characteristics, with some sections showing consistent low activity and others showing bursts of activity.

Given these observations, the EMG signal does not appear to be typical of a healthy individual, as it shows signs of abnormal muscle activity. The presence of significant fluctuations and the potential for muscle fatigue suggest that the subject may have a neuromuscular condition.

[INFO] Line 22: True	 | To determine the subject type based on the provided EMG time series, we can analyze the characteristics of the signal.

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The EMG signal shows significant fluctuations, with peaks reaching up to 6 µV and deep troughs down to -8 µV. This indicates a high level of muscle activity, which can be characteristic of certain conditions.

2. **Patterns of Activity**: The presence of large spikes and deep troughs suggests that there may be irregular muscle activation patterns. This could indicate a pathological condition rather than normal muscle function.

3. **Overall Trends**: The signal appears to have a lot of noise and irregularities, which can be indicative of neuropathic or myopathic conditions. 

4. **Comparison with Normal EMG**: A healthy (normal) EMG typically shows a more stable and less erratic pattern, with less pronounced spikes and a more consistent amplitude.

Given these observations, the EMG signal does not resemble that of a healthy individual. The irregularities and fluctuations suggest a potential neuropathic or myopathic condition.

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The EMG signal shows a range of amplitudes, with peaks reaching around 5 µV and troughs going down to -4 µV. This indicates significant muscle activity.

2. **Patterns**: The signal exhibits a mix of high-frequency bursts and lower-frequency components, which can suggest a combination of normal and abnormal muscle activity.

3. **Variability**: The presence of both positive and negative peaks indicates variability in muscle activation, which can be characteristic of neuropathic conditions.

4. **Overall Trends**: The signal does not show a consistent pattern typical of healthy muscle activity, which would generally have more regular and less erratic fluctuations.

Given these observations, the EMG signal appears to reflect characteristics that are more aligned with neuropathy rather than healthy muscle function or myopathy.

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The EMG signal shows significant fluctuations, with peaks reaching up to approximately 5 µV. This indicates a high level of muscle activity.

2. **Pattern Recognition**: The presence of both high and low amplitude spikes suggests a complex pattern of muscle activation. This could indicate either a healthy muscle response or a pathological condition.

3. **Frequency and Variability**: The variability in the signal, with rapid changes in amplitude, may suggest issues with muscle control or coordination, which can be indicative of neuropathy or myopathy.

4. **Overall Trends**: The overall trend of the signal appears to show a decline in amplitude over time, which could suggest muscle fatigue or a chronic condition.

Given these observations, the characteristics of the EMG signal align more closely with signs of muscle dysfunction rather than a healthy muscle response.

[INFO] Line 38: False	 | To determine the subject type based on the provided EMG time series, we can analyze the characteristics of the signal.

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The time series shows a range of values, including both positive and negative peaks. The presence of high positive values (e.g., 1.9512314796447754) suggests significant muscle activity, which can be indicative of a healthy muscle response.

2. **Variability**: The signal exhibits fluctuations, with some periods of higher activity followed by lower activity. This variability can be typical in healthy muscle function, where muscle fibers are recruited and deactivated in a coordinated manner.

3. **Negative Values**: The presence of negative values (e.g., -1.627838134765625) indicates periods of reduced or absent muscle activity, which can occur in healthy individuals during rest or relaxation phases.

4. **Overall Trends**: The overall trend of the signal appears to show a mix of activity and rest, which is characteristic of normal muscle function. 

Given these observations, the EMG signal does not show clear signs of myopathy (which would typically show more consistent low amplitude and less variability) or neuropathy (which might show irregular firing patterns or more pronounced negative values).

[INFO] Line 0: False	 | To determine the subject type based on the provided EMG time series, we need to analyze the characteristics of the signal. 

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The values in the time series fluctuate between negative and positive values, indicating muscle activity. The presence of both high and low values suggests variability in muscle activation.

2. **Mean and Variance**: The mean of the signal appears to be around zero, with fluctuations indicating some level of muscle activity. However, the presence of negative values and the overall pattern suggests that there may be some underlying issues with muscle function.

3. **Patterns of Activation**: The time series shows periods of low activity (negative values) interspersed with higher activity (positive values). This could indicate a lack of consistent muscle activation, which is often seen in conditions like myopathy or neuropathy.

4. **Comparison with Subject Types**:
   - **Healthy (normal)**: Typically shows consistent and stable muscle activation patterns with minimal fluctuations.
   - **Myopathy**: Often presents with reduced amplitude and more irregular patterns due to muscle fiber damage.
   - **Neuropathy**: Can show irregular patterns and fluctuations in muscle activation due to nerve damage affecting muscle control.

Given the characteristics of the time series, particularly the significant fluctuations and the presence of negative values, it suggests that the subject may have a neuromuscular condition affecting muscle activation.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting classification for the subject type is [C] Neuropathy.

The answer is [C] || 2025-11-13 17:47:18

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The values in the time series show a range of positive and negative values, indicating muscle activity. The presence of both high and low values suggests variability in muscle activation.

2. **Mean Absolute Value (MAV)**: The MAV can be calculated from the time series to assess the overall muscle activation. A higher MAV typically indicates more muscle activity, which is often seen in healthy individuals.

3. **Variance and RMS**: The variance and root mean square (RMS) values can provide insights into the stability and power of the signal. A healthy muscle would typically show a consistent pattern with moderate variance, while myopathy or neuropathy may show more erratic patterns.

4. **Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR)**: This measures how often the signal crosses zero, which can indicate the frequency of muscle activation. A healthy muscle would have a balanced ZCR, while myopathy may show reduced ZCR due to weaker contractions.

5. **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Analyzing the frequency components of the signal can help identify muscle fatigue or abnormal firing patterns. A healthy muscle typically has a higher median frequency, while myopathy or neuropathy may show a shift towards lower frequencies.

Given the provided time series data, the presence of both high and low values, along with the variability in the signal, suggests that the muscle is functioning but may not be at optimal levels. The presence of negative values and the overall pattern of the signal could indicate some form of muscle dysfunction.

Based on these observations, the most likely classification for this subject type is **Myopathy**.

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The values in the time series show a range of positive and negative values, indicating muscle activity. The presence of both high and low values suggests variability in muscle activation.

2. **Trends and Patterns**: The time series shows fluctuations with some peaks and troughs. The presence of negative values indicates periods of reduced muscle activity or potential muscle fatigue.

3. **Signal Characteristics**: The time series has a mix of consistent low values and some higher peaks, which could indicate a muscle that is not functioning optimally. The presence of significant negative values could suggest a pathological condition affecting muscle function.

4. **Comparison with Subject Types**:
   - **Healthy (normal)**: Typically would show consistent and stable EMG readings with less variability and fewer negative values.
   - **Myopathy**: Often characterized by reduced amplitude and increased variability in the EMG signal due to muscle fiber damage.
   - **Neuropathy**: Can show irregular patterns, including both high and low amplitudes, and may include periods of inactivity or reduced muscle activation.

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The time series shows a range of values, with some peaks reaching significant positive values (e.g., 2.619389772415161) and some negative values (e.g., -10.582926750183105). This suggests that there is a considerable variation in muscle activity.

2. **Mean Absolute Value (MAV)**: The MAV can be calculated to assess the overall muscle activation. Given the presence of both high positive and negative values, the MAV would likely indicate a high level of muscle activity.

3. **Variance and RMS**: The variance and root mean square (RMS) values would also be high due to the significant fluctuations in the signal, indicating potential muscle fatigue or abnormal muscle activation patterns.

4. **Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR)**: The ZCR would likely be high, indicating frequent changes in the signal, which can be associated with neuropathic conditions.

5. **Frequency Domain Analysis**: The presence of very high peaks and significant negative values suggests that the muscle activity may not be normal. The high negative values could indicate a loss of muscle control or recruitment, which is often seen in neuropathy.

6. **Overall Pattern**: The time series shows a pattern that includes both high amplitude spikes and significant drops, which is characteristic of neuropathic conditions where muscle fibers may not be firing correctly or consistently.

2. **Mean and Variance**: The mean of the signal appears to be relatively low, with many values hovering around zero, which could indicate a lack of significant muscle activation. The variance would need to be calculated to assess the spread of the signal, but the presence of many small fluctuations suggests a potential for muscle fatigue or weakness.

3. **Patterns of Activation**: The time series shows a pattern of small peaks and troughs, which may indicate a lack of robust muscle contractions. The presence of negative values and the overall low amplitude suggest that the muscle activity is not strong.

4. **Comparison with Subject Types**:
   - **Healthy (normal)**: Typically, a healthy EMG would show clear, strong muscle activation patterns with higher amplitudes and less noise.
   - **Myopathy**: This condition often presents with reduced amplitude and increased variability in the EMG signal due to muscle fiber damage or dysfunction.

2. **Trends and Patterns**: The time series shows periods of both high and low activity, with some segments indicating significant negative values, which could suggest muscle fatigue or dysfunction. The presence of large negative peaks (e.g., -2.5674591064453125) indicates potential issues with muscle function.

3. **Frequency of Zero Crossings**: The data shows a mix of positive and negative values, which can indicate the recruitment of different muscle fibers. However, the presence of sustained negative values may suggest a pathological condition.

4. **Overall Variability**: The time series shows a significant amount of variability, with some sections indicating a lack of consistent muscle activation. This could be indicative of a neuromuscular disorder.

5. **Comparison with Subject Types**:
   - **Healthy (normal)**: Typically would show consistent and stable activation patterns with less variability.
   - **Myopathy**: Would show signs of muscle weakness and potential fatigue, but not necessarily the extreme fluctuations seen here.
   - **Neuropathy**: Often characterized by irregular activation patterns, including periods of inactivity and abnormal muscle responses.

Given the analysis, the significant fluctuations, presence of large negative values, and overall irregularity in the EMG signal suggest that the subject is likely experiencing a neuropathic condition.

[INFO] Line 45: True	 | To determine whether the recording contains a North Atlantic right whale call, we need to analyze the characteristics of the provided time series data and the accompanying visualization.

1. **Duration and Contour**: Right whale calls, particularly up-calls, typically have a rising contour lasting about 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. The visualization shows fluctuations in frequency over time, which suggests the presence of varying sounds.

2. **Frequency Range**: Right whale calls usually fall within the frequency range of approximately 50-300 Hz. The graph indicates that the frequency peaks reach up to 6 Hz, which is significantly higher than the expected range for right whale calls.

3. **Visual Patterns**: The graph shows a lot of noise and fluctuations, but it does not exhibit the characteristic rising contour associated with right whale calls. Instead, it appears more chaotic, which is not typical for the structured calls of right whales.

Based on these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that the recording does not contain a North Atlantic right whale call.

[INFO] Line 60: False	 | To determine whether the recording contains a North Atlantic right whale call, we need to analyze the characteristics of the provided time series data and the accompanying visualization.

1. **Call Characteristics**: A North Atlantic right whale call typically features an up-call with a rising contour lasting approximately 0.5 to 1.5 seconds, and it usually falls within the frequency range of 50-300 Hz.

2. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - The time series data shows fluctuations in amplitude, with some peaks that could indicate calls.
   - The visualization indicates a range of frequencies, with notable peaks that may correspond to whale calls.

3. **Visual Inspection**:
   - The graph shows significant spikes in the frequency range, which could suggest the presence of calls.
   - The overall pattern does not appear to be random noise but rather structured signals that could represent whale calls.

Given these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that the recording likely contains a North Atlantic right whale call.

[INFO] Line 0: True	 | To determine whether the recording contains a North Atlantic right whale call, we need to analyze the provided time series data for specific characteristics associated with right whale calls, particularly the up-call.

1. **Duration**: Right whale up-calls typically last between 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. We need to check if the time series data reflects this duration.

2. **Frequency Range**: Right whale calls, especially up-calls, usually fall within the frequency range of approximately 50-300 Hz. We need to analyze the frequency content of the time series data to see if it falls within this range.

3. **Contour Shape**: The up-call has a rising contour, meaning that the amplitude of the call increases over the duration of the call.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The time series values show a range of fluctuations, with both positive and negative values. 
- The presence of significant peaks and troughs can indicate vocalizations, but we need to focus on the overall pattern.
- The data appears to have a significant peak around the beginning, which could indicate a rising contour, but we need to confirm the duration and frequency.

Given the complexity of the data and the lack of explicit frequency analysis in the provided information, we can make an educated guess based on the characteristics of the time series.

After considering the above factors, it seems that the time series does not clearly indicate a consistent pattern that matches the expected characteristics of a North Atlantic right whale call.

Therefore, I conclude that:

[INFO] Line 1: False	 | To determine whether the recording contains a North Atlantic right whale call, we need to analyze the provided time series data for specific characteristics associated with right whale calls, particularly the up-call.

1. **Duration**: Right whale up-calls typically last between 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. We need to check if the time series data reflects this duration.

2. **Frequency Range**: Right whale calls usually fall within the frequency range of approximately 50-300 Hz. We need to analyze the frequency content of the time series data to see if it falls within this range.

3. **Contour Shape**: The up-call has a rising contour. This means that the amplitude of the call should increase over the duration of the call.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The time series data shows a variety of values, including both positive and negative amplitudes. 
- The presence of significant positive peaks suggests that there may be calls present, but we need to confirm the duration and frequency characteristics.
- The data appears to have a significant peak around 1.0 seconds, which could indicate a call duration within the expected range.
- The values fluctuate between positive and negative, indicating a complex waveform, but we need to focus on the rising contour.

Given the complexity of the data and the presence of significant peaks, it is likely that there is a right whale call present. However, without specific frequency analysis tools or additional context about the time series (like sampling rate), it is difficult to definitively conclude.

Based on the analysis, I would lean towards the presence of a right whale call due to the characteristics observed in the time series data.

[INFO] Line 2: True	 | To determine whether the recording contains a North Atlantic right whale call, we need to analyze the provided time series data for characteristics typical of right whale calls, specifically an up-call with a rising contour lasting approximately 0.5 to 1.5 seconds and typically within the frequency range of 50-300 Hz.

1. **Duration**: The time series data appears to contain a significant number of values, suggesting that it may represent a longer recording. We need to check if there are segments that fit the duration criteria of 0.5 to 1.5 seconds.

2. **Frequency Range**: The values in the time series need to be analyzed to see if they fall within the frequency range of 50-300 Hz. This can be done by examining the amplitude and the nature of the peaks in the data.

3. **Rising Contour**: We need to look for a pattern in the data that indicates a rising contour, which is characteristic of an up-call. This would typically show an increase in amplitude over the specified duration.

Given the complexity of the data and the need for detailed analysis, I will summarize the findings based on the provided time series:

- The time series contains a variety of values, including both positive and negative amplitudes, which may indicate fluctuations in sound pressure levels.
- There are several peaks in the data, but without specific frequency analysis, it is difficult to confirm if they fall within the right whale call frequency range.
- The presence of a clear rising contour is not immediately evident from the raw values provided.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the recording does not clearly exhibit the characteristics of a North Atlantic right whale call.

After careful consideration, it appears that the time series does not exhibit the clear rising contour and frequency characteristics typical of a North Atlantic right whale call.

[INFO] Line 7: True	 | To determine whether the recording contains a North Atlantic right whale call, we need to analyze the provided time series data for characteristics typical of right whale calls, specifically an up-call with a rising contour lasting approximately 0.5 to 1.5 seconds and typically within the frequency range of 50-300 Hz.

1. **Duration**: The time series data must show a rising contour that lasts between 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. We need to look for a sequence of values that indicates a gradual increase in amplitude over this time frame.

2. **Frequency Range**: The frequency of the call should be within the range of 50-300 Hz. This can be inferred from the values in the time series, where higher values may indicate higher frequencies.

3. **Contour Shape**: The call should exhibit a rising contour, meaning that the values should start lower and gradually increase to a peak before potentially decreasing again.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The values in the time series show fluctuations, but we need to focus on the overall trend. 
- The first few values start at -0.998784601688385 and rise to 1.1347854137420654, indicating a potential rising contour.
- The values fluctuate significantly, with some negative values and some positive values, which may indicate noise or other sounds mixed in.
- The overall pattern does not consistently maintain a rising contour throughout the series, and there are many fluctuations that do not align with the expected characteristics of a right whale call.

Given these observations, the time series does not consistently exhibit the characteristics of a North Atlantic right whale call.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the recording does not contain a right whale call.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The values in the time series range from negative to positive, indicating fluctuations in amplitude. 
- The presence of both positive and negative values suggests that there are variations in the sound pressure levels, which is typical for whale calls.
- The overall pattern of the values shows a rising trend at the beginning, which could indicate the rising contour characteristic of an up-call.

However, without specific frequency analysis (like a Fourier transform) to confirm that the dominant frequencies fall within the 50-300 Hz range, we cannot definitively conclude that this is a right whale call based solely on the time series values.

However, based on the presence of significant fluctuations and the potential for a rising contour, it is reasonable to suggest that there may be a right whale call present.

1. **Duration**: The time series data appears to contain a significant number of values, suggesting that it may represent a longer recording. We need to check if there are segments that fit the duration criteria of 0.5 to 1.5 seconds.

2. **Frequency Analysis**: The frequency range of interest is between 50-300 Hz. We would need to analyze the values in the time series to see if they fall within this range. 

3. **Contour Shape**: The up-call is characterized by a rising contour. This means we should look for a pattern in the time series where the values increase over a short duration, indicating a rising pitch.

4. **Peak Analysis**: We should also look for peaks in the data that might indicate the presence of a call.

Given the complexity of the data and the need for detailed analysis, I will summarize the findings based on the characteristics mentioned:

- The time series shows fluctuations that could indicate vocalizations, but without specific frequency analysis, it's difficult to confirm the presence of calls within the desired frequency range.
- The data does not clearly indicate a rising contour characteristic of a right whale up-call.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The time series values show a variety of fluctuations, but we need to focus on the overall pattern and characteristics.
- The presence of both positive and negative values indicates that there are fluctuations in amplitude, which is typical for vocalizations.
- We need to check the duration of the call by observing the number of data points and the sampling rate (if provided). However, since we don't have the sampling rate, we can only make a qualitative assessment based on the data provided.

Given the complexity of the data and the lack of explicit duration and frequency analysis, we can make a qualitative judgment based on the presence of fluctuations and the overall pattern.

[INFO] Line 56: True	 | To determine whether the recording contains a North Atlantic right whale call, we need to analyze the provided time series data for specific characteristics associated with right whale calls, particularly the up-call.

1. **Duration**: Right whale up-calls typically last between 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. We need to check if the time series data reflects this duration.

2. **Frequency Range**: Right whale calls usually fall within the frequency range of approximately 50-300 Hz. We need to analyze the frequency content of the time series data to see if it falls within this range.

3. **Contour Shape**: The up-call has a rising contour. We need to assess if the time series shows a rising pattern over the duration of the call.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The time series data consists of a series of numerical values that represent the amplitude of the sound over time.
- The values fluctuate, indicating changes in amplitude, which is typical for sound recordings.
- To determine the frequency content, we would typically perform a Fourier Transform, but we can also visually inspect the values for patterns.

From the provided data, we can see that there are fluctuations in the values, and there are positive and negative values indicating a waveform. However, without performing a detailed frequency analysis, we cannot definitively conclude the frequency range or the contour shape.

Given the complexity of the data and the lack of explicit frequency analysis, it is challenging to confirm the presence of a right whale call based solely on the provided time series values.

Given the complexity of the data and the lack of specific frequency analysis tools in this context, I will rely on the general characteristics of the time series.

After reviewing the time series data, it appears that the fluctuations do not clearly indicate a rising contour typical of a right whale call. The data does not show a consistent pattern that aligns with the expected characteristics of a right whale up-call.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I conclude that:

[INFO] Line 99: False	 | To determine whether the recording contains a North Atlantic right whale call, we need to analyze the provided time series data for characteristics typical of right whale calls, specifically an up-call with a rising contour lasting approximately 0.5 to 1.5 seconds and typically within the frequency range of 50-300 Hz.

1. **Duration**: The call should last between 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. We need to check the time series data to see if there are segments that fit this duration.

2. **Frequency Range**: The call should typically fall within the frequency range of 50-300 Hz. We can analyze the values in the time series to see if they fall within this range.

3. **Rising Contour**: The call should have a rising contour, which means that the amplitude of the call should increase over the duration of the call.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The values in the time series range from negative to positive, indicating fluctuations in amplitude.
- The presence of both positive and negative values suggests that there are variations in the signal, but we need to focus on the overall trend.
- We can look for a segment of the time series that shows a clear rising trend over a duration that fits the specified time frame.

Upon reviewing the time series data, it appears that there are segments where the values rise significantly, indicating a potential call. However, without specific frequency analysis tools or additional context about the sampling rate and the exact duration of the rising segments, it is challenging to definitively classify this as a right whale call.

Given the complexity of the data and the need for precise analysis, I would conclude that:

[INFO] Line 0: False	 | To determine whether the recording contains a North Atlantic right whale call, we need to analyze the provided time series data for specific characteristics associated with right whale calls, particularly the up-call with a rising contour.

1. **Duration**: Right whale up-calls typically last between 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. We need to check if the time series data reflects this duration.

2. **Frequency Range**: Right whale calls usually fall within the frequency range of approximately 50-300 Hz. We need to analyze the values in the time series to see if they fall within this range.

3. **Contour**: The up-call has a rising contour, which means that the amplitude of the call should increase over the duration of the call.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The first value in the series is **0.3095**, which is within the frequency range.
- The subsequent values fluctuate, but we need to check the overall trend. The values show a mix of positive and negative fluctuations, but there are several peaks that could indicate a rising contour.
- The presence of a significant peak (like **1.4590**) suggests that there are moments of increased amplitude, which is consistent with the characteristics of a right whale call.

Given these observations, the time series data does show characteristics that could be consistent with a North Atlantic right whale call, particularly the presence of rising amplitude and values within the expected frequency range.

Therefore, I conclude that the recording likely contains a North Atlantic right whale call.

[INFO] Line 18: True	 | To determine whether the recording contains a North Atlantic right whale call, we need to analyze the provided time series data for specific characteristics associated with right whale calls, particularly the up-call.

1. **Duration**: Right whale up-calls typically last between 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. We need to check if the time series data reflects this duration.

2. **Frequency Range**: Right whale calls usually fall within the frequency range of approximately 50-300 Hz. We need to analyze the values in the time series to see if they fall within this range.

3. **Contour**: The up-call has a rising contour, which means that the amplitude of the call should increase over the duration of the call.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The values in the time series show fluctuations, with both positive and negative values, indicating variations in amplitude.
- The presence of both high and low values suggests that there are peaks and troughs, which could indicate a call.
- However, we need to specifically look for a consistent rising pattern over a duration of 0.5 to 1.5 seconds.

Upon reviewing the time series data, it appears that there are fluctuations, but there is no clear indication of a rising contour that would suggest a typical right whale up-call. The data does not consistently rise over the specified duration, and the frequency range is not explicitly provided in the data.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the recording does not contain a North Atlantic right whale call.

1. **Duration**: Right whale up-calls typically last between 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. We need to check if the time series data reflects this duration.

2. **Frequency Range**: Right whale calls usually fall within the frequency range of approximately 50-300 Hz. We need to analyze the frequency content of the time series data to see if it falls within this range.

3. **Contour Shape**: The up-call has a rising contour, which means that the amplitude of the call increases over time. We need to look for a pattern in the time series that indicates a rising amplitude.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The time series data shows a variety of values, including both positive and negative amplitudes. 
- The presence of large positive values (e.g., 4.607035160064697) suggests that there are peaks in the data, which could indicate vocalizations.
- However, the presence of large negative values (e.g., -9.230550765991211) and the overall variability in the data may suggest that this is not a clear, consistent up-call characteristic of North Atlantic right whales.
- The data does not provide a clear indication of a rising contour over a sustained period, which is essential for identifying an up-call.

Given these observations, it appears that the characteristics of the time series do not align with the expected features of a North Atlantic right whale call.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the recording does not contain a North Atlantic right whale call.

1. **Duration**: The call should last between 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. We will need to check the time series data to see if there are segments that fit this duration.

2. **Frequency Range**: The call should typically fall within the frequency range of 50-300 Hz. We will analyze the values in the time series to see if they correspond to this frequency range.

3. **Rising Contour**: The call should have a rising contour, which means that the amplitude of the call should increase over the duration of the call.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The values in the time series range from negative to positive, indicating fluctuations in amplitude. 
- The first value is 1.2029951810836792, which is a positive amplitude, suggesting a potential start of a call.
- The subsequent values fluctuate, with some negative values indicating a drop in amplitude, but there are also positive values that suggest the presence of a call.
- The overall pattern does not show a clear rising contour throughout the series, as there are many fluctuations and dips.

Given the complexity of the data and the lack of a clear rising contour, along with the presence of both positive and negative values, it is difficult to definitively classify this as a North Atlantic right whale call.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the recording does not contain a North Atlantic right whale call.

[INFO] Line 81: False	 | To determine whether the recording contains a North Atlantic right whale call, we need to analyze the provided time series data for specific characteristics associated with right whale calls, particularly the up-call with a rising contour.

1. **Duration**: Right whale up-calls typically last between 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. We need to check if the time series data reflects this duration.

2. **Frequency Range**: Right whale calls usually fall within the frequency range of approximately 50-300 Hz. We need to analyze the frequency content of the time series data to see if it falls within this range.

3. **Contour Shape**: The up-call is characterized by a rising contour. This means that the amplitude of the call should increase over the duration of the call.

Now, let's analyze the provided time series data:

- The time series data shows a variety of values, including both positive and negative amplitudes. 
- The presence of significant positive values suggests that there are peaks, which could indicate vocalizations.
- However, to confirm the presence of a right whale call, we would need to perform a spectral analysis to determine the frequency content and check for a rising contour.

Given that the data is presented in a complex format and without specific frequency analysis results, it is challenging to definitively conclude whether it contains a right whale call based solely on the time series values provided.

Considering the lack of clear evidence from the time series data regarding the characteristics of a right whale call, I would conclude:

- The time series data contains a variety of values, both positive and negative, indicating fluctuations in sound pressure levels.
- The values range from approximately -3.5 to 3.5, which suggests that there are significant variations in amplitude.
- To determine the frequency content, we would typically apply a Fourier Transform to analyze the frequency spectrum. However, we can also visually inspect the data for rising patterns.

Upon visual inspection of the time series data, we can see that there are segments where the values rise and fall, but we need to confirm if there is a clear rising contour that lasts for the appropriate duration.

Given the complexity of the data and the lack of explicit frequency analysis in this context, we can conclude that:

- The data does not clearly indicate a sustained rising contour typical of a right whale call.
- The overall characteristics do not strongly suggest the presence of a right whale call.

[INFO] Line 7: False	 | To classify the transient electromagnetic event based on the provided power-density time series, we need to analyze the characteristics of the data.

1. **Initial Observation**: The time series starts with a consistent value of approximately -0.677, indicating a stable low power density for a significant duration. This suggests a lack of significant activity at the beginning.

2. **Subsequent Values**: After the initial stable period, there are fluctuations in the power density, with values ranging from -0.8 to positive values, indicating some activity. However, the overall trend appears to be negative with occasional spikes.

3. **Event Characteristics**:
   - **Sharp Turn-On + Noise**: This would typically show a sudden increase in power density followed by noise, which is not observed here.
   - **Slow Ramp-Up to Attachment + Spike + Exponential Decay**: This pattern would show a gradual increase leading to a peak, which is not consistent with the data.
   - **Paired Impulsive Peaks**: This would show distinct pairs of peaks, which are not evident in the time series.
   - **Gradual Intra-Cloud Increase**: This would show a sustained increase in power density over time, which is not the case here.
   - **Off-Record**: This would indicate incomplete or abruptly ending data, which does not apply as the data is complete.
   - **I Impulsive Event**: This would show a sudden spike without prior gradual increase, which is not the case here.
   - **I2 Impulsive Event Pair (TIPP)**: This would show closely spaced pairs of sharp peaks, which are not present.

4. **Conclusion**: The time series shows a prolonged period of low power density with some fluctuations but lacks the characteristics of the other event types. The consistent low values suggest that this could be indicative of a **Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke** (KM), where the power density remains low with occasional fluctuations.

Therefore, the best match for the transient electromagnetic event based on the provided time series is:

The answer is [F] || 2025-11-13 18:06:08
[INFO] Line 8: False	 | To classify the transient electromagnetic event based on the provided power-density time series, we need to analyze the characteristics of the data.

1. **Initial Observations**: The time series starts with a series of negative values, indicating a low power density. This is followed by fluctuations that include both negative and positive values, suggesting some form of activity or event.

2. **Key Features**:
   - The series shows a gradual increase in power density after a period of low values, which is indicative of a slow ramp-up.
   - There are spikes in the data, particularly towards the end of the series, where the values rise significantly, suggesting a strong transient event.
   - The presence of both negative and positive values indicates that there may be multiple phases to the event, which could include both downward and upward spikes.

3. **Event Type Matching**:
   - **CG Positive Initial Return Stroke**: This typically features a sharp turn-on followed by noise, which does not match the gradual increase observed.
   - **IR Negative Initial Return Stroke**: This involves a slow ramp-up to a spike, which aligns with the observed gradual increase and subsequent spikes.
   - **SR Subsequent Negative Return Stroke**: This involves multiple peaks following an initial stroke, which does not seem to be the case here.
   - **I Impulsive Event**: This would show a sudden peak without prior gradual increase, which does not match the observed pattern.
   - **I2 Impulsive Event Pair (TIPP)**: This would show paired peaks, which is not evident in the data.
   - **KM Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke**: This involves a gradual increase in power, which aligns with the observed pattern but lacks the strong spikes seen in the data.

[INFO] Line 25: False	 | To classify the transient electromagnetic event based on the provided power-density time series, we need to analyze the characteristics of the waveform.

1. **Initial Observation**: The time series starts with a consistent value of approximately -0.7865 for a significant duration, indicating a stable baseline before any significant changes occur.

2. **Waveform Characteristics**:
   - The series shows a gradual increase and decrease in values after the initial stable period, with fluctuations around the baseline.
   - There are no sharp spikes or sudden changes that would indicate impulsive events.
   - The waveform appears to have a gradual ramp-up and down, which is characteristic of a gradual intra-cloud stroke.

3. **Event Type Matching**:
   - **CG Positive Initial Return Stroke**: This would typically show a sharp turn-on followed by noise, which is not observed here.
   - **IR Negative Initial Return Stroke**: This would show a slow ramp-up to a spike, which is not evident in the data.
   - **SR Subsequent Negative Return Stroke**: This would show multiple peaks, which are not present.
   - **I Impulsive Event**: This would show a sudden peak, which is not observed.
   - **I2 Impulsive Event Pair (TIPP)**: This would show paired peaks, which are not present.
   - **KM Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke**: This matches the observed gradual changes in the waveform.
   - **O Off-record**: The waveform does not appear to be cut off or incomplete.

Based on the analysis, the best match for the provided time series is the **KM Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke**, as it exhibits the characteristics of a gradual increase and decrease in power density without impulsive features.

[INFO] Line 28: False	 | To classify the transient electromagnetic event based on the provided power-density time series, we need to analyze the characteristics of the data.

1. **Initial Observation**: The time series starts with a consistent value of approximately -0.6346 for a significant duration, indicating a stable baseline before any significant changes occur.

2. **Subsequent Changes**: After the initial stable period, there are fluctuations in the power density values, with some values rising above zero, indicating potential spikes or changes in the electromagnetic event.

3. **Event Characteristics**:
   - The initial stable period suggests a lack of activity, which is typical for events that do not start with a sharp turn-on.
   - The fluctuations that follow do not show a clear pattern of sharp spikes or multiple peaks, which would be indicative of impulsive events or return strokes.
   - The gradual changes in power density suggest a more sustained event rather than a quick impulsive event.

4. **Comparison with Event Types**:
   - **CG Positive Initial Return Stroke**: Typically characterized by a sharp turn-on followed by noise.
   - **IR Negative Initial Return Stroke**: Involves a slow ramp-up to a spike followed by an exponential decay.
   - **SR Subsequent Negative Return Stroke**: Involves multiple peaks following an initial stroke.
   - **I Impulsive Event**: Characterized by sudden peaks without prior gradual increases.
   - **I2 Impulsive Event Pair (TIPP)**: Involves closely spaced pairs of sharp peaks.
   - **KM Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke**: Characterized by a gradual increase in power density over time, which aligns with the observed gradual changes in the time series.
   - **O Off-record**: Indicates incomplete or abruptly ending waveforms.

Given the characteristics of the time series, the best match is the **KM Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke**, as it aligns with the observed gradual changes in power density without impulsive spikes or sharp transitions.

[INFO] Line 57: False	 | To classify the transient electromagnetic event based on the provided power-density time series, we need to analyze the characteristics of the data.

1. **Initial Observation**: The time series starts with a constant value of approximately -0.341, indicating a stable baseline for a significant duration. This suggests that the event may not have a sharp turn-on characteristic, which is typical for events like the CG Positive Initial Return Stroke.

2. **Subsequent Values**: After the initial stable period, there are fluctuations with some values dipping below -0.3 and then returning to around -0.34. This pattern does not exhibit the characteristics of a sharp spike or a gradual ramp-up, which are typical for other event types.

3. **Event Characteristics**:
   - **CG Positive Initial Return Stroke**: Would show a sharp increase followed by noise.
   - **IR Negative Initial Return Stroke**: Would show a slow ramp-up followed by a spike and exponential decay.
   - **SR Subsequent Negative Return Stroke**: Would show multiple peaks.
   - **I Impulsive Event**: Would show a sudden peak without prior gradual increase.
   - **I2 Impulsive Event Pair (TIPP)**: Would show paired peaks.
   - **KM Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke**: Would show a gradual increase in power.
   - **O Off-record**: Would show incomplete or abruptly ending waveforms.

4. **Conclusion**: The time series data does not show any of the characteristics of the impulsive events or the gradual increases. Instead, it appears to be a continuous signal with fluctuations around a baseline, which is indicative of an off-record event.

Based on this analysis, the best match for the transient electromagnetic event is:

[INFO] Line 8: False	 | To classify the transient electromagnetic event based on the provided power-density time series, we need to analyze the characteristics of the data.

1. **Initial Observations**: The time series starts with a series of negative values, indicating a low power density. This is followed by fluctuations that include both negative and positive values, suggesting some form of activity or event.

2. **Key Features**:
   - The series shows a gradual increase in power density after a period of low values, which is indicative of a slow ramp-up.
   - There are spikes in the data, particularly towards the end of the series, where the values rise significantly, suggesting a strong transient event.
   - The presence of both gradual increases and sharp spikes aligns with the characteristics of certain event types.

3. **Event Type Analysis**:
   - **CG Positive Initial Return Stroke**: Typically characterized by a sharp turn-on followed by noise. This does not match the gradual increase observed.
   - **IR Negative Initial Return Stroke**: Involves a slow ramp-up to a spike followed by an exponential decay. The gradual increase and subsequent spikes in the data could match this pattern.
   - **SR Subsequent Negative Return Stroke**: Involves multiple peaks but is typically after an initial return stroke. This does not seem to fit the observed pattern.
   - **I Impulsive Event**: Characterized by a sudden peak without prior gradual increase. This does not match the gradual ramp-up observed.
   - **I2 Impulsive Event Pair (TIPP)**: Involves paired peaks, which is not evident in the data.
   - **KM Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke**: Involves a gradual increase in power density but typically does not show sharp spikes. This could be a possibility but the spikes suggest otherwise.
   - **O Off-record**: This would indicate an incomplete waveform, which does not apply here as the data appears complete.

Given the analysis, the best match for the observed time series is **[B] IR Negative Initial Return Stroke**, as it aligns with the characteristics of a slow ramp-up followed by spikes.

1. **Initial Values**: The time series starts with a consistent value of approximately -0.4556795060634613 for a significant number of samples, indicating a stable baseline.

2. **Subsequent Values**: After the initial stable period, the values fluctuate, showing some variability but remaining mostly negative. There are some positive spikes, but they are not very pronounced.

3. **Patterns**: The time series does not exhibit a sharp turn-on or a clear ramp-up to a spike, which would be indicative of a CG Positive Initial Return Stroke or an IR Negative Initial Return Stroke. 

4. **Gradual Changes**: The fluctuations appear to be gradual rather than impulsive, which suggests that it may not fit the impulsive event categories (I or I2).

5. **Overall Trend**: The overall trend seems to be a gradual increase and decrease without significant sharp peaks or a clear exponential decay, which aligns more with a gradual intra-cloud stroke.

Based on these observations, the best match for the transient electromagnetic event type is:

[INFO] Line 33: False	 | To classify the transient electromagnetic event based on the provided power-density time series, we need to analyze the characteristics of the data.

1. **Initial Observations**: The time series starts with a consistent value of approximately -0.4277 for a significant duration, indicating a stable baseline. This is followed by fluctuations that include both negative and positive values, suggesting some form of activity.

2. **Key Features**:
   - The initial part of the series shows a long period of stability at -0.4277, which is characteristic of a non-active state.
   - The fluctuations that follow include both sharp increases and decreases, indicating some transient activity.
   - The presence of significant positive peaks (e.g., values around 1.0614317655563354 and 11.551530838012695) suggests impulsive events.

3. **Event Type Analysis**:
   - **CG Positive Initial Return Stroke**: Typically characterized by a sharp turn-on followed by noise. This does not match the observed pattern.
   - **IR Negative Initial Return Stroke**: Involves a slow ramp-up to a spike followed by an exponential decay. The data does not show a clear ramp-up.
   - **SR Subsequent Negative Return Stroke**: Involves multiple peaks following an initial stroke. The data does not show a clear pattern of multiple peaks.
   - **I Impulsive Event**: Characterized by a sudden peak without prior gradual increase. The data shows significant peaks, which could indicate impulsive events.
   - **I2 Impulsive Event Pair (TIPP)**: Involves paired peaks. The data does not show consistent pairs of peaks.
   - **KM Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke**: Involves a gradual increase in power. The data does not show a gradual increase.
   - **O Off-record**: Indicates incomplete waveforms. The data does not appear to be cut off or incomplete.

Given the analysis, the presence of significant peaks and the overall pattern of the time series suggest that the best match is an impulsive event.

[INFO] Line 45: False	 | To classify the transient electromagnetic event based on the provided power-density time series, we need to analyze the characteristics of the data.

1. **Initial Observations**: The time series starts with a consistent negative value of approximately -0.909, indicating a stable low power density for a significant duration. This is followed by fluctuations that suggest some variability in the signal.

2. **Key Features**:
   - The initial part of the series shows a long period of stability at a low power density, which is characteristic of a gradual ramp-up or a sustained low power level.
   - There are fluctuations that indicate some activity, but they do not show the sharp spikes or rapid changes typically associated with impulsive events.
   - The series does not exhibit the sharp turn-on or noise characteristic of a CG Positive Initial Return Stroke or an IR Negative Initial Return Stroke.

3. **Event Type Matching**:
   - **CG Positive Initial Return Stroke**: Characterized by a sharp turn-on followed by noise. This does not match the observed pattern.
   - **IR Negative Initial Return Stroke**: Involves a slow ramp-up to a spike followed by an exponential decay. The series does not show a clear spike or exponential decay.
   - **SR Subsequent Negative Return Stroke**: Involves multiple peaks and is typically less pronounced than the initial stroke. The series does not show multiple peaks.
   - **I Impulsive Event**: Characterized by a sudden peak without prior gradual increase. This does not match the observed pattern.
   - **I2 Impulsive Event Pair (TIPP)**: Involves paired peaks. The series does not show paired peaks.
   - **KM Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke**: Characterized by a gradual increase in power and sustained high power levels. The series shows a long period of low power followed by fluctuations, which could suggest a gradual increase.
   - **O Off-record**: Indicates an incomplete waveform. The series appears complete and does not show abrupt cut-offs.

Given the analysis, the best match for the provided time series is:

[INFO] Line 69: False	 | To classify the transient electromagnetic event based on the provided power-density time series, we need to analyze the characteristics of the data.

1. **Initial Observations**: The time series starts with a series of negative values, indicating a low power density. There are several segments where the values remain constant at around -0.78, suggesting a stable low power state.

2. **Patterns**: As we progress through the time series, we see fluctuations with both negative and positive values. The presence of sharp transitions from negative to positive values indicates potential spikes in power density.

3. **Event Characteristics**:
   - The series shows a gradual increase in power density after a period of stability, which is characteristic of a gradual intra-cloud stroke.
   - The fluctuations and the eventual rise in values suggest that this could be a gradual increase rather than a sharp impulsive event.

4. **Comparison with Event Types**:
   - **CG Positive Initial Return Stroke**: Typically characterized by a sharp turn-on followed by noise.
   - **IR Negative Initial Return Stroke**: Involves a slow ramp-up to a spike followed by an exponential decay.
   - **SR Subsequent Negative Return Stroke**: Involves multiple peaks following an initial stroke.
   - **I Impulsive Event**: Characterized by a sudden peak without prior gradual increase.
   - **I2 Impulsive Event Pair (TIPP)**: Involves paired peaks.
   - **KM Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke**: Characterized by a gradual increase in power density over time.
   - **O Off-record**: Incomplete waveform.

Given the gradual increase in power density observed in the time series, the best match for this event is:
